This is a very silly, but fun, input method for mouse movement.

Start it with "start driving", stop it with "stop driving".

Doing the pop noise, or saying "car gas" will make the car start or stop moving. Hissing will turn the car, but hissing for just a short moment will change the turn direction between clockwise and counterclockwise.

say "car reverse" turns the car 180 degrees instantaneously. "car flip" works like the short hiss and changes between clockwise and counterclockwise.

"car nudge" will move the car for a tiny amount of time.

"car boost" will turn the turbo mode on or off.

the car will bounce off the sides of your screen when it hits them.

you can say "car north" with any of the 16 points of the compass (E, ESE, SE, SSE, S, SSW, SW, WSW, W, WNW, NW, NNW, N, NNE, NE, ENE) to set the car in a certain direction, even while driving.

finally, say "car random" to turn a random "demonstration mode" on or off.

The car mode will turn itself off automatically after 45 seconds of no commands / input. Random mode will run longer than that.

BUGS:

* Before you pop the first time, the car is displayed in the top left corner of the screen, but immediately teleports to the center when started

TODO:

* [ ] Short demonstration video / gif
* [ ] submit noise support to knausj
* [ ] Restrict the car to the focussed window
* [ ] More control over the speed and turn rate of the car
* [ ] "preview" for a given course, perhaps the ability to plan ahead as if editing splines in a vector graphics program
